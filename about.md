K(not) a Conversation is an artistic research project exploring the concepts of artificial intelligence, creativity and labour. Through interactive installations inspired by ancient indigenous communication systems of Quipu knots, it instigates a communication and reflection process through the use of knots and AI systems. Started in 2020 as part of the BeFantastic CoLab Fellowship during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been displayed at Vorspiel / transmediale & CTM and India Art Fair. 

Please, [get in touch](mailto::hello@knotaconversation.art) for collaborations and follow on {% include icon-instagram.html username=site.instagram_username label='Instagram' %}
